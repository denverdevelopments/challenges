The array class has various methods of removing elements from the array.

Let's look at the array

 arr = [5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3]
Delete an element from the end of the array
 > arr.pop
 => 3
Delete an element from the beginning of the array
 > arr.shift
 => 5
Delete an element at a given position
 > arr.delete_at(2)
 => 4
Delete all occurrences of a given element
 > arr.delete(5)
 => 5
 > arr
 => [6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3]
Your task is to complete the functions below using syntax as explained above.

def end_arr_delete(arr)
    # delete the element from the end of the array and return the deleted element

end

def start_arr_delete(arr)
    # delete the element at the beginning of the array and return the deleted element

end

def delete_at_arr(arr, index)
    # delete the element at the position #index

end

def delete_all(arr, val)
    # delete all the elements of the array where element = val

end
