#1.  Read string by letter form left to right (array.shift)
    #push back into new array after evaluating
#2.  Check if next letter is bigger, for subtraction

#3.  Add correct value to total (start at 0)

#4.  Repeat eval process, add new value to total

#5.  Stop after last array entry, return total
